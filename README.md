My work from physics 188

So in homework 2 we were doing some data analysis by fitting gaussians to our 2D data. This allowed us to understand the distribution of our data a little bit better. We looked at the probability densities of a a binomial distribution with 2 outcomes. Then the stirlings formula approximation showing convergence to 0 as N goes to infinity. We were looknig at the central limit theorem

Then we fit data two a straight line using linear regression. Using chi squared merti function to measure how well the model agrees with the data. Parameter optimization to minimize chi squared(set chi squared second deriv to 0). 

Intro to supervised learning. Create a nueral network for 1 dimensional data set. Using squared error for the loss function. Risk is average loss over sample.

Gradient descent to minimize Risk using finite differencing.

UMAP + clustering, unsupervised learning to identify numbers from an image based in pixels
  UMAP is dimension reduction algortihm(usually unsupervised)
  using nearest neighbors, min dist, metric, and n components
  
HDBSCAN for clustering(density based techniques, QUITE ADVANCED!)
